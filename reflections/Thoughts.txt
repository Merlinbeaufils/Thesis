Current open questions of the project:
    How to reduce size of the tree?
        analysis of tags, attributes and data
            much data unusable
            Only around 60 tags are actually used more than once. Make "other" tag
            Which tags and in what context present useless data?
            What about attributes?

    which tags, attributes and data are irrelevant?
        Does this change depending on the end task?

    How to format load the samples as tree and masked subtree?

    Which resources and how to use ssh for training?

    How will I evaluate my project?
        Html generator?
        masking and recovering subtrees
        downstream tasks:
            next site guess
            click probability

    Which modeling strategies will I use?
        1) masking self-supervised learning
        2) graph deep-learning?
        3) bag of words?

Current tasks:
    Making a path through the nodes of the tree.
        Which node(s) should have the path? How much info to keep?
        BFS or DFS?
    Implementing dataloader with tree-subtree pairs.

Finished:
    HTML parser for building tree
    HTML parser for analysis of tags, attributes and data
    Analysis code for tags. Almost for attrs and data
    HtmlNode class for the html tree
